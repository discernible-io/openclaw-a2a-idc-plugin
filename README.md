[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) [A2A protocol](https://a2a-project.org/) community plugin.
Send messages and files to other agents over the internet, and/or allow your agent to receive messages and files with Tailscale.
The plugin is powered by [A2A Utils](https://github.com/a2anet/a2a-utils), a comprehensive set of utility functions for using [A2A servers (remote agents)](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/topics/key-concepts/#core-actors-in-a2a-interactions), that powers the [A2A MCP Server](https://github.com/a2anet/a2a-mcp).

The plugin gives your agent 6 tools to send messages and files to other agents without relying on a third-party chat app or email:

- `a2a_get_agents` to list the agents it's connected to
- `a2a_get_agent` to view an agent's skills in detail
- `a2a_send_message` to send messages and files. The agent will respond with a `context_id` and `task_id`, which your agent can use to continue the conversation.
- `a2a_get_task` to poll for a response if either agent loses connection or a response hasn't been recieved in over a minute
- `a2a_view_text_artifact` to view large text responses that have been minimised
- `a2a_view_data_artifact` to view large data responses that have been minimised

The plugin also allows your agent to receive messages and files with Tailscale and other reverse proxies (nginx, Caddy, etc).
It's secure by default, requiring you to generate an API key (`openclaw a2a generate-key <label>`) for each agent you want to give access to.
Your agent will see the sender (`<label>`), and each inbound message creates a separate conversation that is identified by the sender (`<label>`) and `context_id`.
This way, your agent can support multiple conversations simulateneously, including from the same sender.

## 📺 Demo

Watch [OpenClaw A2A Plugin Demo - Connect your OpenClaw to other OpenClaws (and agents) over the internet](https://youtu.be/bodb7ATn5nc?si=9uVltb4K6-4Z8hPE) on YouTube.

## 📦 Installation

Install the IdentyClaw fork:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @discernible-io/openclaw-a2a-idc-plugin
```

During development you can also install from a local path or git URL. Upstream package: `@a2anet/openclaw-a2a-plugin` (API-key auth only).

Restart the gateway:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

Follow the set up instructions in "🔐 IdentyClaw usage (RODiT peers)", "📤 Sending Messages (outbound)", and/or "📥 Receiving Messages (inbound)".

## 🔐 IdentyClaw usage (RODiT peers)

This fork authenticates A2A peers with **RODiT / Passport JWTs** via [`@rodit/rodit-auth-be`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rodit/rodit-auth-be), instead of pre-shared A2A API keys. Outbound callers log in with NEAR Passport credentials; inbound peers present short-lived JWTs signed by the IdentyClaw API.

Legacy **API key** auth remains available for development or non-RODiT peers (`inbound.auth.provider: "apiKey"`, or `allowApiKeyFallback: true` with RODiT).

### Environment variables

Outbound RODiT login reads these env vars by default (override names with `outbound.auth.credentialsEnv`):

| Variable | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| `IDENTYCLAW_ACCOUNT_ID` | NEAR account id (Passport owner) |
| `IDENTYCLAW_NEAR_PRIVATE_KEY` | Ed25519 private key (`ed25519:…` or base58) |
| `IDENTYCLAW_BASE_URL` | IdentyClaw API base URL (e.g. `https://api.identyclaw.com`) |

Keep credentials in env or secrets files — not in `openclaw.json`.

### Embedding in OpenClaw chat / gateway (quiet mode)

When this plugin is enabled, OpenClaw loads it in **chat** (`node dist/index.js chat`) as well as the **gateway**. [`@rodit/rodit-auth-be`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rodit/rodit-auth-be) logs JSON to stdout and `node-config` warns on stderr at **import time**, which can appear inline in the chat TUI.

This plugin **lazy-loads** `rodit-auth-be` only on the first inbound JWT validation or outbound `login_server` call, and applies quiet embed defaults before import:

| Variable | Default when unset |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `error` |
| `SUPPRESS_NO_CONFIG_WARNING` | `true` |
| `SUPPRESS_STRICTNESS_CHECK` | `true` |

Host env vars always win — IdentyClaw agents can set these in `.env` (e.g. via `sync_quiet_plugin_env` on bootstrap). Override per-plugin with `inbound.auth.logLevel` or `outbound.auth.logLevel` in `openclaw.json` until upstream `rodit-auth-be` defaults to library-quiet mode.

### Outbound: call a RODiT peer

Configure the remote agent's Agent Card URL and enable dynamic JWT login. Do **not** set `custom_headers.Authorization` for RODiT peers; the plugin obtains and caches the Bearer token automatically (refreshes once on HTTP 401).

```json
{
    "plugins": {
        "entries": {
            "a2a": {
                "enabled": true,
                "config": {
                    "outbound": {
                        "auth": {
                            "provider": "rodit",
                            "jwtCacheTtlSeconds": 300
                        },
                        "agents": {
                            "agent-b": {
                                "url": "http://openclaw-agent-b:18789/.well-known/agent-card.json"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `auth.provider` | `"rodit"` | — | Enable `login_server` JWT acquisition for all outbound agents |
| `auth.credentialsEnv` | `{ accountId, privateKey, baseUrl }` | `IDENTYCLAW_*` | Env var names for Passport credentials |
| `auth.jwtCacheTtlSeconds` | `number` | `300` | In-memory JWT cache TTL before re-login |
| `auth.logLevel` | `string` | `error` | Winston level for `rodit-auth-be` when loaded |

Non-auth `custom_headers` on individual agents still work (e.g. tracing headers).

### Inbound: accept RODiT peer JWTs

```json
{
    "plugins": {
        "entries": {
            "a2a": {
                "enabled": true,
                "config": {
                    "inbound": {
                        "publicBaseUrl": "https://agent-a.diholai.io",
                        "auth": {
                            "provider": "rodit",
                            "issuer": "https://api.identyclaw.com",
                            "audience": "agent-a.diholai.io",
                            "identityClaim": "token_id"
                        },
                        "agentCard": {
                            "name": "Juanelo",
                            "description": "IdentyClaw agent"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `auth.provider` | `"rodit"` \| `"apiKey"` \| `"none"` | `"apiKey"` | Inbound authentication mode |
| `auth.issuer` | `string` | — | Expected JWT `iss` (IdentyClaw API URL) |
| `auth.audience` | `string` | — | Expected JWT `aud` — **must match how peers reach this agent** |
| `auth.identityClaim` | `string` | `"token_id"` | JWT claim used as inbound sender label / thread key |
| `auth.allowApiKeyFallback` | `boolean` | `false` | When `provider` is `rodit`, also accept configured `apiKeys` |
| `auth.logLevel` | `string` | `error` | Winston level for `rodit-auth-be` when loaded |
| `publicBaseUrl` | `string` | — | External base URL for Agent Card `url` fields (see below) |

Verified peer JWTs map to a sender label (e.g. Passport `token_id`) used for inbound conversation routing, the same role `apiKeys[].label` plays for API-key auth.

### `publicBaseUrl` and reverse proxies

By default, Agent Card URLs are derived from the incoming request (`Host`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`). Behind a reverse proxy or when internal container DNS differs from the public hostname, set `inbound.publicBaseUrl` so discovery advertises the URL peers actually use:

```json
"inbound": {
    "publicBaseUrl": "https://agent-a.diholai.io"
}
```

**Pair `publicBaseUrl` with `auth.audience`** when using RODiT — both should reflect the same external hostname peers call. Mismatched `audience` causes all inbound JWT validation to fail.

Example Agent Card endpoint after configuration:

```text
https://agent-a.diholai.io/a2a
```

(`publicBaseUrl` + `/a2a` for single-agent mode; multi-agent mode appends `/a2a/<agentId>`.)

### Internal vs external peer URLs

Use different URLs depending on who is calling:

| Caller | Agent Card URL | Notes |
| ------ | -------------- | ----- |
| agent-a → agent-b (same Podman network) | `http://openclaw-agent-b:18789/.well-known/agent-card.json` | Container DNS; outbound config only |
| agent-b → agent-a (same Podman network) | `http://openclaw-agent-a:18789/.well-known/agent-card.json` | Container DNS; outbound config only |
| External peer → agent-a | `https://agent-a.diholai.io/.well-known/agent-card.json` | Public hostname; matches `publicBaseUrl` |

Outbound peers use the **discovery URL from their config** (`outbound.agents.<id>.url`). Inbound agents use **`publicBaseUrl`** (when set) for the URL embedded in their own Agent Card.

### External URL layout (same host)

A2A shares the gateway host with OpenClaw hooks but uses separate paths:

```text
agent-a.example.com/hooks/agent              → OpenClaw hooks (unchanged)
agent-a.example.com/a2a                      → A2A JSON-RPC
agent-a.example.com/.well-known/agent-card.json  → A2A discovery
```

Do not mount A2A under `/hooks/a2a` unless you rewrite Agent Card URLs at the proxy.

### Development fallback

For local testing without Passport JWTs, use API keys as upstream does, or enable RODiT with API key fallback:

```json
"inbound": {
    "auth": { "provider": "rodit", "issuer": "…", "audience": "…", "allowApiKeyFallback": true },
    "apiKeys": [{ "label": "dev-peer", "key": "…" }]
}
```

- **Host multiple agents** — expose several agents from one gateway, each with its own `/a2a/<agentId>` endpoint, Agent Card discovery URL, and card metadata
- **Send and receive files** — outbound messages can include local file paths (up to 1MB) or URLs; inbound files are saved locally
- **Multi-turn conversations** — continue conversations across multiple messages using `context_id`
- **Long-running task support** — if `a2a_send_message` times out, use `a2a_get_task` to monitor until the task reaches a terminal state
- **Automatic artifact minimization** — large text and data artifacts are automatically minimized for LLM context windows, with dedicated tools for detailed navigation
- **Inbound authentication** — RODiT / Passport JWT validation (IdentyClaw fork), plus API key-based auth with timing-safe comparison, per-key labels, and CLI key management
- **Outbound RODiT login** — dynamic JWT acquisition and cache refresh for IdentyClaw peers (no static `Authorization` headers in config)

- **Custom headers and outbound auth** — per-agent custom headers with `${ENV_VAR}` substitution for secrets
- **Configurable timeouts and limits** — control character limits, timeouts, poll intervals, and whether to enable task and file storage

## 🤖 A2A Core Concepts

The [A2A protocol](https://a2a-project.org/) is a protocol for agent-to-agent communication supported by AWS, Azure, GCP, and [150+ enterprises](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/partners/).

- **Agent Card** — A JSON object at a publicly available URL (e.g. `/.well-known/agent-card.json`) that describes an agent (name, description, skills, etc).
- **Message** — a single communication turn between agents, containing one or
  more Parts. Each message has a role (`user` or `agent`).
- **Part** — content within a Message, Task, or Artifact: text (`TextPart`), JSON data (`DataPart`), or files (`FilePart`).
- **Task** — a unit of work with a unique ID. Useful for long-running tasks, agents can disconnect and poll intermittently.
- **Artifact** — output produced by a task (e.g. generated text, JSON data, files).

## 📤 Sending Messages (outbound)

### Set Up

Configure at least one remote agent in your OpenClaw config. You just need the
remote agent's Agent Card URL (and API key, if required). No Tailscale or port
exposure needed.

### Tools

The `a2a_*` tools are registered when at least one agent is configured (`agents`).
The plugin is powered by [A2A Utils](https://github.com/a2anet/a2a-utils), for example tool usage, results, etc. see [A2A Utils JavaScript A2ATools](https://github.com/a2anet/a2a-utils/blob/main/javascript/README.md#a2atools).

#### `a2a_get_agents`

List all available remote A2A agents with names and descriptions.

No parameters.

#### `a2a_get_agent`

Get detailed info about a specific agent, including skills.

| Parameter  | Type   | Required | Description                   |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `agent_id` | string | Yes      | The agent's unique identifier |

#### `a2a_send_message`

Send a message to a remote agent and receive a structured response. The message
is sent non-blocking — the tool streams or polls for updates until the task
reaches a terminal state or the timeout is reached. If the task is still in
progress after the timeout, the current task state is returned. Use
`a2a_get_task` with the returned `id` to continue monitoring.

| Parameter    | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent_id`   | string | Yes      | ID of the target agent                                                                                                                                     |

| `agents`                | `object`  | —                                    | Named inbound agents, keyed by agent ID. Each value takes an `agentCard` (`name`, `description`, `skills`). See [Hosting Multiple Agents](#hosting-multiple-agents).             |

#### Hosting Multiple Agents

A single gateway can expose several agents, each as its own addressable A2A
endpoint. Add `inbound.agents`, keyed by agent ID. Each key is both the URL
path segment and the OpenClaw agent ID that handles the message, so a message
to `/a2a/swe` is routed to the OpenClaw agent `swe`. The key must match a
configured OpenClaw agent ID, or requests to it will fail to route.

```json
{
    "plugins": {
        "entries": {
            "a2a": {
                "enabled": true,
                "config": {
                    "inbound": {
                        "apiKeys": [{ "label": "flynn", "key": "..." }],
                        "agents": {
                            "swe": {
                                "agentCard": {
                                    "name": "SWE",
                                    "description": "Software engineering agent",
                                    "skills": [
                                        { "id": "code", "name": "Code", "description": "Writes and reviews code" }
                                    ]
                                }
                            },
                            "pmo": {
                                "agentCard": { "name": "PMO", "description": "Project management agent" }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Each agent gets its own JSON-RPC endpoint and Agent Card discovery URL:

| Agent | JSON-RPC endpoint | Agent Card discovery URL    |
| ----- | ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| `swe` | `/a2a/swe`        | `/a2a/swe/agent-card.json`  |
| `pmo` | `/a2a/pmo`        | `/a2a/pmo/agent-card.json`  |

The `apiKeys` / `allowUnauthenticated` settings apply to every agent on the
host. Each agent can update its own card at runtime with `a2a_update_agent_card`
— the edit is scoped to the calling agent and persisted under its
`inbound.agents.<agentId>.agentCard`. When `inbound.agents` is omitted, a single
agent is exposed on the default `/a2a` and `/.well-known/agent-card.json` paths,
configured via `inbound.agentCard`.

#### 2. Restart the Gateway

The plugin registers its HTTP endpoints on startup, so a restart is required:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

#### 3. Expose Your Gateway

You need to make your gateway's HTTP port (default 18789) reachable from the
internet. [Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel) is the
recommended approach — it gives your machine a public HTTPS URL with automatic
TLS certificates, no port forwarding or DNS configuration needed. You can also
use any reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, etc.).

> **Note:** The commands below were verified on **macOS** (Apple Silicon)
> with the [Tailscale Mac app](https://tailscale.com/download/mac). The
> overall flow is the same on Linux and Windows, but the install and daemon
> setup will differ — consult the
> [Tailscale install docs](https://tailscale.com/kb/1347/installation) for
> your OS.

##### Install Tailscale

Install the **[Tailscale Mac app](https://tailscale.com/download/mac)**. The GUI app ships a Network Extension
that plumbs MagicDNS into macOS's system resolver, so browsers and other apps
can resolve your `*.ts.net` hostname.

After installing, launch the app, click the Tailscale menu bar icon, and
sign in. The CLI is bundled with the app.

Confirm you're online:

```bash
tailscale status
```

You should see your node name, tailnet IP, and user.

##### Provision an HTTPS Certificate

Funnel needs a LetsEncrypt cert for your node's `*.ts.net` name. Running
`tailscale cert` once provisions it and also confirms that HTTPS certificates
and MagicDNS are enabled on your tailnet:

```bash
cd /tmp && tailscale cert "$(tailscale status --json | jq -r '.Self.DNSName | rtrimstr(".")')"
```

The `cd /tmp` is because `tailscale cert` writes `<host>.crt` and
`<host>.key` to the current directory.

##### Enable Funnel

```bash
tailscale funnel --bg http://localhost:18789
```

On success, Tailscale prints the public URL, e.g.:

```
Available on the internet:

https://your-machine.tailXXXXXX.ts.net/
|-- proxy http://localhost:18789
```

If the `funnel` command fails with a policy error, you need to add the
Funnel ACL attribute in the [admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/acls/file)
(there is no CLI equivalent for editing ACLs):

```json
"nodeAttrs": [
  {
    "target": ["autogroup:member"],
    "attr": ["funnel"]
  }
]
```

It can take up to a minute or two after `tailscale funnel --bg` returns
before the public URL actually serves traffic from the open internet,
because the Funnel edge has to propagate your config and finish TLS
provisioning. If an external request returns a TLS error or "broken pipe",
wait ~60s and retry.

##### Tailscale Serve (Tailnet-Only)

If you only need agents on your tailnet to reach you (not the public internet),
use Tailscale Serve instead of Funnel:

```bash
tailscale serve --bg http://localhost:18789
```

With Serve, traffic is restricted to your tailnet, so disabling authentication
is reasonable.

##### Stopping Funnel

```bash
tailscale funnel --https=443 off
```

#### 4. Verify

Open your Agent Card URL in a browser:

```
https://your-machine.tail123.ts.net/.well-known/agent-card.json
```

You should see the JSON Agent Card (name, description, skills, etc.).

#### 5. Generate an API Key

The Agent Card is public, but for other people to send messages to your OpenClaw you'll need to generate an API key for them:

```bash
openclaw a2a generate-key flynn
```

#### 6. Customise Your Agent Card

The Agent Card will have default values.
Once you've generated an API key, ask your OpenClaw to use the `a2a_update_agent_card` tool to update its Agent Card:

> Update your Agent Card with the `a2a_update_agent_card` tool

#### 7. Share Your URL and Key

Send your Agent Card URL and the generated API key to the person you generated it for.
They'll need to install the plugin and add your OpenClaw as a remote agent with the headers:

```json
"custom_headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer [GENERATED API KEY]"
}
```

That's it! Your friend's agent should now be able to send messages and files to your OpenClaw.

### Tools

The `a2a_update_agent_card` tool is registered when inbound is configured
(`apiKeys`, RODiT auth, or `allowUnauthenticated`).

#### `a2a_update_agent_card`

Live-update this agent's A2A Agent Card name, description, or skills. Changes
take effect immediately and persist to config — no restart needed. At least one
field must be provided. When `inbound.agents` is configured, the edit is scoped
to the calling agent's own card.

| Parameter     | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | string | No       | Display name for the Agent Card                                                                |
| `description` | string | No       | Description for the Agent Card                                                                 |
| `skills`      | array  | No       | Skills to advertise (objects with `id`, `name`, `description`, and optional `tags`/`examples`) |

## 🌐 HTTP Endpoints

| Endpoint                          | Method | Auth         | Description                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/.well-known/agent-card.json`    | GET    | No           | Returns the Agent Card for discovery (single-agent configuration)                              |
| `/a2a`                            | POST   | Bearer token | JSON-RPC 2.0 endpoint supporting `message/send`, `message/stream`, `tasks/get`, `tasks/cancel` |
| `/a2a/<agentId>/agent-card.json`  | GET    | No           | Returns the Agent Card for `<agentId>` (when `inbound.agents` is configured)                   |
| `/a2a/<agentId>`                  | POST   | Bearer token | JSON-RPC 2.0 endpoint for `<agentId>` (when `inbound.agents` is configured)                    |

With RODiT inbound auth, the Bearer token is a Passport JWT (not a static API key). Agent Cards advertise `securitySchemes` with HTTP Bearer + JWT when `inbound.auth.provider` is `rodit`.

### Supported JSON-RPC Methods

| Method           | Description                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `message/send`   | Send a message and wait for the full response          |
| `message/stream` | Send a message with Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming |
| `tasks/get`      | Get the status and details of a task                   |
| `tasks/cancel`   | Cancel an ongoing task                                 |

### Error Codes

| Code     | Meaning                 |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| `-32700` | Parse error             |
| `-32600` | Invalid request         |
| `-32601` | Method not found        |
| `-32602` | Invalid params          |
| `-32001` | Authentication required |
| `-32000` | Server error            |

## 💾 Data Storage

Tasks and file artifacts are saved locally, separated by direction. Task state lives under OpenClaw's state directory; file artifacts live under OpenClaw's workspace directory so the agent can access received files.

| Direction | Type  | Path                              |
| --------- | ----- | --------------------------------- |
| Outbound  | Tasks | `<state>/a2a/outbound/tasks/`     |
| Outbound  | Files | `<workspace>/a2a/outbound/files/` |
| Inbound   | Tasks | `<state>/a2a/inbound/tasks/`      |
| Inbound   | Files | `<workspace>/a2a/inbound/files/`  |

When `inbound.agents` is configured, each agent's inbound tasks and files are
isolated under its agent ID — `<state>/a2a/inbound/<agentId>/tasks/` and
`<workspace>/a2a/inbound/<agentId>/files/`.

Outbound task/file storage can be disabled with `outbound.taskStore: false` and `outbound.fileStore: false`.
